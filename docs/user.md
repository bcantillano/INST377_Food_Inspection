# User Manual

Our project solves the problem that areas of potential hazards (failed food inspection) are difficult to identify from pre-existing mapping/visualization programs. There is currently no software or program pulls food inspection data from the Prince George’s County database. 

This application could be useful to many users, incuding Prince George’s County residents, restaurant managers/owners/investors in PG County, and even the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The information that we compile in our web application can be used for a variety of needs; we believed it's biggest use would be UMD students looking to find "safe" restaurants to visit.

To navigate through the map and find compliant and non-compliant restaurants, the user must use their mouse. To move around the map, click and drag; to zoom in, either use your scroll wheel or the "+" and "-" buttons located on the map. 

Users will be able to view "hot-spots," or clusters of areas with restaurants that have failed food inspections. Users will then be able to click on and select invididual restaurants to view their compliance status. When users click a restaurant, they will be able to see the name, latitude, and longitude coordinates of the establishment.
