# INST377 Food Inspection

## Description
Restaurant food inspection heat mapping and tracking software built on JS/Leaflet. Map-based web app of Prince George's County. Users will be able to move around the map and determine “hot-spot” areas where there are a high concentration of food establishments that have failed food inspections. The goal of our project is to show users the sanitary conditions of restaurants in Prince George's County in a simple way. Users will be able to select specific areas and individual restaurants to determine whether it is compliant or not.
